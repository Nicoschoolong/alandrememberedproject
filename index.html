  <h1>Summary</h1>
  <p>In 1858 Tobias moved down to Florida with his wife named Emma from George after the civil war ended and left due to the southern states being in an economic depression.  Tobias and Emma had a child named Zech, this is when Tobias had the idea to have a farm dedicated to cattles since this was when cattles were getting expensive and a profitable business. They moved the cattles to Punta russia to ship them to Cuba. Along the way Zech met his soon to be wife Glenda and on the journey ahead Tobias died from malaria. Before Tobias died Emma died from a heart attack. Glenda and Zech had a child named Solomon and soon all the assets of the family went to Solomon. With all of this Solomon managed to have a lot of money and power. This led him to be greedy and lose his morals because of greed and he learned his mistakes and went back to the city where the business of the started to boom and died there from a heart attack.</p>
